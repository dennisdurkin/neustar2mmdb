Note: these instructions have only been tested on OS X 10.10. Your computer is
different than mine; YMMV.

MaxMind only provides a perl library for writing the database format:
https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Writer-perl
 
perlbrew seems like the optimal approach, as I don't entirely trust Apple to
ship a sane version/config of Perl. I had to run this twice; YMMV:

$ sudo cpan App::perlbrew

 
The permissions resulting from that then need to be fixed if you want to
install as non-root:

$ sudo chown -R <username>:staff ~/perl5

 
Run the initialization script

$ perlbrew init

 
Edit your .bashrc/.bash_profile  to include the following, and then run the
following if you don't want to start a new session: (this assumes that you want
to install modules in $HOME/perl5, so adjust accordingly or remove)

. ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc
# adds $HOME/perl5/bin to PATH
[ $SHLVL -eq 1 ] && eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)" 

 
Install the current stable version of Perl (set j to the desired number of
parallel build processes):

$ perlbrew install -j 3 stable

 
Install cpanm, the less-insane to install modules with Perl:

$ perlbrew install-cpanm

 
MaxMind seems to be awful at correctly annotating dependencies... or passing
their tests before they ship. Install these extra packages:

$ cpanm JSON YAML Devel::Refcount

 
You need to force the arch to amd64, as the default is both 64- and 32-bit, and
then some of the IPv6 stuff with 128-bit ints explodes in x86. You need -n to
skip running the unit tests, as it did not pass them as of the time of this
writing, at which point it all ought to work:

$ ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" cpanm -n MaxMind::DB::Writer::Tree
